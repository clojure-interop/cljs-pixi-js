  "The Geometry represents a model. It consists of two components:
  - GeometryStyle - The structure of the model such as the attributes
  - GeometryData - the data of the model - this consists of buffers.
  This can include anything from positions, uvs, normals, colors
  Geometry can be defined without passing in a style or data if
  (thats how I prefer!)
